Guessing Game

This Python program challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number. The user inputs their guess, and the program provides feedback if it's too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point the program displays the number of attempts it took. It's a fun and interactive way to test your guessing skills. Simply run the program, follow the prompts, and enjoy the game!
